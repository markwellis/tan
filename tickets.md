when smilies were being replaced with img tag, but it wasn't closed, chrome was refusing to render the ajax recieved content.

I've hacked the doctype to html5 in an untestable attempt to stop this, also have fixed the img tag problem, but it's not a long term soultion.

seems to be mootools asking for text/xml, instead of text/html. hmmm

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mootools-users/1HQeLJ_vMt0

investigate the cause and find a proper fix.

try making a standalone html page that requests the broken html and injects it and see if it breaks xhtml page and works on html5 page, find a fix

also it's not valid html5

Editing/Posting Comments:
This small thing Irks me. Whenever you post or edit a comment, it loads a completely new page just so you can edit it, then pressing submit loads a completely new page again, which completely loads a new page again until you can actually see your comment.

-To somehow implement a system (Kind of like Youtube profile comments) where it didn't take you out of the article and all the comments whenever you posted a comment or edited your comment.

-To have a standard hotbar above each comment or edit comment that you do that allows you to bold, italic, colorize etc your text. Not having this by now is shocking to say the least.

-Remove the comment rating system. I think in all my time on shoutwire, I've looked at this once and said "Wow this is un-necessary".

Submitting Articles:

One thing that really irks me as well is the amount of spam useless articles submitted everyday. I recently found that you have to enter the code in the image in order to submit. I've noticed a significant decrease in spam submissions. Good job.

General Suggestions:

This is purely for social value, but someone could simply invent a ranking system for SW users. It might be based on how long that user has been registered with SW.

Example, a guy who has been on SW for 2+ years might have a ranking of "Old Facker" or something. It might be worth looking into to improve the mood of SW.

-Changing the Name of "Promoted Blogs" to "Top 5 Blogs"

Well that's all I can think of for now, I'm sure there's more.

If anyone cares and agrees with me or not, feel free to comment.
